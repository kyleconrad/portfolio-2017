    	<p>How do you rebrand and redesign an agency that's been an industry leader for almost twenty years? At nclud, we started from the ground up, going back to our roots as a company: the convergence of design and technology. Taking inspiration from everything from neo-grotesque type design to old computer terminals to the neon lights of Blade Runner, we built a brand designed to push the limits and make people nervous. As part of the rebrand, we needed the new website to be bold, unique, different &mdash; a site that could stand head and shoulders above the competition. On the design side, we incorporated the bright ultraviolet purple and cathode greens to make the site feel electric on screen, as well as laying everything out with strong type and imagery in Massimo Vignelli's Swiss three-column grid. In development, we incorporated WebGL headers to create stunning real-time image effects that react to mouse movement and device orientation, glitch transitions between pages to replicate the effect of a flickering old terminal screen, and built out a static template and integration system (to avoid tying ourselves to an unwieldy content management system). The final component was the copy &mdash; creating a tone of voice that's plain but strong, speaking with a purpose and cutting through the buzzwords. We wrote long-form case studies in order to tell the full stories behind our work and results, not just to show off pretty screens. The site was nominated for a 2015 Webby Award in the Website / Professional Services category and was awarded CSS Design Awards Website of the Day. A fully responsive static site, nclud was built using Three.js, WebGL, Gulp, and SASS.</p>
